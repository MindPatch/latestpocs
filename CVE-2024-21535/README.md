##  CVE-2024-21535 - markdown-to-jsx XSS

### Overview

This pull request upgrades the `markdown-to-jsx` package to version **7.4.0** or higher. The previous versions of this package are affected by a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via the `src` property due to improper input sanitization. Specifically, versions below 7.4.0 are vulnerable to XSS attacks when rendering potentially malicious markdown containing an iframe element.

### Problem Description

The `markdown-to-jsx` package is a lightweight, customizable React markdown component. Affected versions (below 7.4.0) improperly sanitize user input, making it possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML elements, such as an iframe containing malicious JavaScript.

This vulnerability can be exploited to run arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser, leading to security issues like session hijacking, data theft, or even full compromise of the web application.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

1. Run: `npx create-react-app local-react` to create a sample React app.
2. Navigate to the newly created directory: `cd local-react`.
3. Install the vulnerable version of the package: `npm install markdown-to-jsx@7.3.2`.
4. Replace the content of `App.js` with the following code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Markdown from 'markdown-to-jsx';

const markdown = `<iframe src="javascript:alert('XSS')"></iframe>`;

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Markdown>
        {markdown}
      </Markdown>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

5. Run: `npm start` to start the application.

With this setup, the application will render the malicious iframe, triggering the JavaScript code (`alert('XSS')`) in the user's browser.
